  s.description       = <<desc
    Rails plugin that makes stamping records with a user when they are 
    created and updated dirt simple. It assumes that your controller has 
    a current_user method. It also assumes that any record being stamped
    has two attributes--creator_id and updater_id. You can override both
    of these assumptions easily.
